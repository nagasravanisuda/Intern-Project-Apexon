# 📊 Data and AI Engineering Internship Project – Apexon (March 2025 – July 2025)

This repository contains the end-to-end data engineering project completed during my internship at **Apexon** as a **Data and AI Engineering Intern**. The project involved processing and analyzing large-scale healthcare data using modern data engineering tools and architectures.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to build a scalable, cloud-based data pipeline that supports exploratory data analysis, reporting, and analytics on raw healthcare data.

### ✨ Key Goals:
- Clean and transform raw datasets from cloud sources
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract insights
- Build ETL pipelines using Delta Lake and Medallion Architecture
- Develop SQL and PySpark queries for business-driven analysis
- Visualize patterns and trends in the data for decision-making
